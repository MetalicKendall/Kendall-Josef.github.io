                <h1>About Myself</h1>
                <p>My Name is Kendall Josef. I am a first year college student at Renton Technical College. I am currently working on obtaining an Assosiates degree in Computer Science. I have a passion for computers and will interact with them in my free time. I like to modify video games and add things to them that you normally would not see in them. I also like to tinker with devices to see how they work. I am very skilled at finding information and applying it in a short amount of time.   </p>
